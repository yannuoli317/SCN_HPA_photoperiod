# SCN_HPA_photoperiod
This repository provides code files for the paper "Light-induced Synchronization of  the SCN Coupled Oscillators and Implications for Entraining the HPA axis". 

File "Distance_dependent_network_Rsyn_number.m" and "Distance_dependent_network_Rsyn_dmax.m" explore the R synchronization changes under different distance limit between core and shell as well as different neuron numbers in the distance-dependent network.
File "Probablity-dependent_cell_number_Rsyn.m" and "Probability_dependent_prob_Rsyn.m" explore the R synchronization changes under different distance limit between core and shell as well as different neuron numbers in the probability-dependent network.

File "Connection_probability_dmax.m" compares the synchronization efficiency in two different networks.
Function file "er.m" is used to calculate synchronization levels.
File "Probablity_dependent_model_properties.m" calculates properties of the probablity-dependent model under different photoperiods.
File "Shift_frequency_probability_Rsyn.m" explores the role of temporal topology shift within the SCN in its synchronization level
